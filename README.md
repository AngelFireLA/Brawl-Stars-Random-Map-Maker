# Brawl-Stars-Random-Map-Maker
By the creator of Brawler Maker, I present you the BS Random Map Maker
This a tool to generate brawl stars map with random tiles

Customizable via settings file :
- map height
- map width
- presets for the 2 above (3v3 and showdown)
- you can choose how many maps to generate
- you can choose the percentage of empty space in your map

If you're going to import maps in game :
- take you maps.csv
- - open it and go at the botom line
- put the number at the start of last line in the settings.txt (lastlineid)
- this is so you can just copy and paste the text in maps.csv (no need to add any numbers or map name or anything)
Warning : you still need to add the map in locations.csv to be able to see it in-game

**Tutorial (windows/linux/android) :**
- (Windows/Linux) Install python (don't forget to check the box "add to path in python's setup)
- (Android) Download pydroid3 from playstore
- (Every Platform) download the script and settings.txt from latest release
- extract it in any folder (but it's better if there isn't any other files in the folder)
- change the settings.txt to your hearth desire
- (Android) open Pydroid3 and open the script, and run it
- (Windows/Linux) Just launch the script (search on google if you don't know how to launch a python script)
