# Brawl-Stars-Random-Map-Maker
This a tool to generate brawl stars map with random tiles

Customizable via settings file :
- map height
- map width
- presets for the 2 above (3v3 and showdown)
- you can choose how many maps to generate
- you can choose the percentage of empty space in your map

If you're going to import maps in game :
- take you maps.csv
- - open it and go at the botom line
- put the number at the start of last line in the settings.txt (lastlineid)
- this is so you can just copy and paste the text in maps.csv (no need to add any numbers or map name or anything)
Warning : you still need to add the map in locations.csv to be able to see it in-game
